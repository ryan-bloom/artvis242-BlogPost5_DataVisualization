This piece, entitled "We Were Strangers Once Too" and found through The Office for Creative Research, really caught my eye when I was looking for data visualization art pieces.  It originally stood out to me because of its physical, real world nature.  Prior to seeing this work, at least in my mind, I thought of most data visualization pieces as existing in the digital world or online.  I never really realized that data visualization pieces of artwork could exist in the physical world as well.  That is why I originally looked into this piece.  This visualization sculpture was displayed in the winter of 2017 in Time Square in New York City as a statement towards the way in which immigrant populations have shaped NYC.  

After looking deeper into this work and reading about its purpose and the data that it does visualize, I enjoy and appreciate the piece even more.  Although relatively simple as compared to various other works with respect to the types and range of data being visualized, this piece makes an extremely strong statement.  It consists of 33 metal poles with the counts of NYC immigration populations from various nations.  The larger the immigration population is from a specific nation, the larger that nation's patch of pink on a pole is.  This correlation is found in many data visualization works, and I will work to implement this connection between visual size and data size as well.  Although the physical nature of this sculpture inhibits viewrs' interaction with the actual display of the piece, it does allow a different kind of interaction with its viewers.  The piece was open to the public and people were able to walk around and through the poles, physically interacting with them and further understanding the importance of, and vast presence, immigration in New York City.

### Art Piece 2

This second piece of artwork, created by Jer Thorp and entitled "Data in an Alien Context: Kepler Visualization," caught my eye for a different reason than the artwork discussed above.  This piece portrays bright and vibrant colors on a black background, which allows these shapes and colors to truly pop off the screen.  Furthermore, the massive quantity of data points in thiis piece made me curious about what they represented, and how their colors and sizes were determined.  This piece was created and released in 2012.

Upon further research, it was found that this piece of work represents data regarding the 2327 exoplanets identified by NASA.  It is fascinating how many different data categories Jer Thorp was able to visualize as well as the ways that he did so.  The sizes of each data point were selected based on the planet radius where larger dots represent exoplanets with greater radii.  Then, the colors of the data points vary based on temperature, from red hot to cool blue.  Furthermore, users can interact with this piece zooming in and out, as well as displaying the points on different graphs (both radial and linear) representing various data categories ranging from size, to temperature, to astronomical units.  The user interaction with this piece, as well as the range of data represented, really differentiates it from the work discussed above.  Moving forward, I hope to be able to display a wide range of data categories in unique and interesting ways in my visualization piece as well.
